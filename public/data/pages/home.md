### Welcome to **react-carosel-info-site**  
This is a Demo webapp meant to show you this digital product.  
It is realized in **React**, **HTML** and **Bootstrap** for CSS rules.  
  
It is not necessary to have a database (like SQLServer or MySQL) in order to have a site with dynamic content.  
  
You can change the content by editing the json files and the markdown of the 'data' folder. *react-carosuel-info-site* display them.  
As an example, you can show, in the section below, the files that home page read.
